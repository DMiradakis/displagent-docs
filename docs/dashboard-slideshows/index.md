# Dashboard Slideshows

This section introduces you to Dashboard Slideshows and how to build them.

## What is a Dashboard Slideshow?

A Dashboard Slideshow is a Displagent slideshow type that is built from a specific Power BI *dashboard*.

::: warning
Don't forget the differences between a Power BI *report* and a Power BI *dashboard*. Recall that a Power BI *dashboard* is a set of pinned visuals or visual pages from one or more Power BI reports.
:::

A Dashboard Slideshow is limited to **one, specific Power BI dashboard** from a given Power BI workspace. The dashboard can be from any workspace, so long as your service account that you used during setup has access to the workspace.

::: tip
Many Early Adopters have asked if Dashboard Slideshows can support **more than one Power BI dashboard at a time**. Per their design, they cannot.

But despair not: this is exactly what Compound Slideshows are designed for! Checkout the [Compound Slideshows](/compound-slideshows/) section to learn more.

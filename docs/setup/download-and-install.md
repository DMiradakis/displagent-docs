# Download and Install

Since Displagent is a cross-platform desktop application, you will need to download and install it on your machine. Here is a brief guide on how to do that.

## Download Displagent

To download Displagent, please visit the main site's [download page](https://www.displagent.io/download) and click the download icon that is appropriate for your machine's operating system.

::: tip
To confirm that you have downloaded the correct file type for your machine, please look to the file extension reference table below.
:::

| Operating System | File Extension | Status |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Windows | `.exe` | Supported |
| Mac OS | `.dmg` | Coming soon |
| Linux | `.AppImage` | Supported |

## Install Displagent

To install Displagent, simply open/run the executable file. Displagent will install itself on your machine **relative to your user account**, so it is unlikely that you will require admin permissions to install.

::: tip
For example, on Windows, the default installation path will be: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Displagent`.

### AppImage Installation

If you are installing Displagent on a Linux machine (such as a Raspberry Pi), you may need to right-click the `.AppImage` file and **enable execution permissions**. See this [AppImage guide](https://discourse.appimage.org/t/how-to-run-an-appimage/80) for an example.
